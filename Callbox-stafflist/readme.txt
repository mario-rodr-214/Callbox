Thinking of the UI design was probably the most time consuming part. I didnt want to just list the staff on an webpage, 
I wanted to spice up the user interaction when someone is looking for a certain person or department.So I added the sticky 
navbar with the department names so that when a user clicks the desired department, the webpage jumps staight to it.
