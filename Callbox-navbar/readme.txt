I wanted to create a navbar that was simple and used jquery to animate the dropdown menu in an normal sized browser 
and still maintain the functionally as it would if were viewing on a smaller sized screen such as a mobile device. 
I wanted to add an background image to spice things up a bit to be more visually pleasing but for the simplicity 
of the instructions I left the aside. I used visual studio with an extension called "Quick html previewer", however 
in some browsers the dropdown icon is weird characters but I assume that could be fixed if I could use a library or 
framework with better icons.
